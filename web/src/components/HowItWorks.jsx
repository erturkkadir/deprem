Our model embeds each feature as a complex number, which has both a magnitude and a phase angle. This means each embedding dimension carries two pieces of information: "how strongly this feature is present" (magnitude) and "what role it plays in this context" (phase). Think of it as giving the model a richer, two-dimensional workspace to represent relationships between earthquake features. When the model combines embeddings through attention and feed-forward layers, it uses true complex multiplication — where magnitude and phase interact — rather than treating them as independent numbers.',

In complex space, their relationship has both strength AND direction — the phase angle encodes how these features relate to each other in a way real numbers cannot. This is especially relevant for geospatial patterns: cyclic features like longitude (where 179° and -179° are neighbors), time of day, and lunar phase are naturally represented as rotations in complex space. The entire transformer — embeddings, attention, feed-forward layers, activations — operates in this complex domain.',
